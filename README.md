# Eye-Health-Awareness
For the Nextech Summer Coding Challenge, I have built a website addressing eye health during COVID-19 (directly from the infection and indirectly from increased screen time). To access this website, download the entire repository first - this can be done by clicking on the "Code" button, and then clicking on "Download ZIP". After downloading it, click and open the zip file. Inside the folder, open the folder named "Eye Health Awareness - Nextech Summer Coding Challenge." Finally, navigate inside this folder, and simply click on the file named "index.html."
