# Eye-Health-Awareness
For the Nextech Summer Coding Challenge, I have built a website addressing eye health during COVID-19 (directly from the infection and indirectly from increased screen time). To access this website, download the entire folder named "Eye Health Awareness - Nextech Summer Coding Challenge." After that, navigate inside the folder, and simply click on the file named "index.html."
