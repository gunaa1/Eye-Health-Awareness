# Eye-Health-Awareness
For the Nextech Summer Coding Challenge, I have built a website addressing eye health during COVID-19 (directly from the infection and indirectly from increased screen time). To access this website, download the entire repository first - this can be done by clicking on the "Code" button, and then clicking on "Download ZIP". Then, open the folder named "Eye Health Awareness - Nextech Summer Coding Challenge." Finally, navigate inside the folder, and simply click on the file named "index.html."
